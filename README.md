# Overview of the Project
# Title of Project: Vulnerability Scanning Tool
# Problem Statement
Design a tool to evaluate the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on password strength.

# Description
This is a Python-based security audit tool that scans a target host (IP address or domain) for potential security vulnerabilities. The tool probes for open ports, inspects HTTP headers, and detects outdated server software and security vulnerabilities.

# Features
1. Probes for open ports on the target host
2. Inspects HTTP headers for security-related information
3. Detects outdated server software (Apache and nginx)
4. Identifies security vulnerabilities in HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security)

# How to Use
1. Save this code in a file.
2. Run the script using Python.3. 
3. Enter the target host (IP address or domain) when prompted.
4. The tool will perform the security audit and display the results.

# Note
This tool is for educational purposes only.
